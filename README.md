👋 Hi, I’m @Arohi70
👀 I’m interested in creating innovative educational tools that make learning more accessible and environmentally friendly. I’m passionate about technology, product design, and exploring new ideas that can make a real difference in the world.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming, game development with pygame, and the basics of product development. I’m also working on refining my digital writing pad concept, which aims to reduce the weight of school bags and promote eco-friendly learning.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to educational technology, especially those that focus on sustainable solutions and improving the learning experience for students. I’m also open to collaborating with developers, designers, and entrepreneurs who share a passion for innovation.
📫 How to reach me [arohi6d8868@gmail.com]. Feel free to connect with me if you’re interested in discussing new ideas, collaborating on projects, or just want to chat about technology and education.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a high school student who loves dancing and has a deep passion for Korean culture. I dream of studying IT in South Korea one day and contributing to the global tech community.
